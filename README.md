This project analyses multi-year air pollution patterns at two UK urban background sites (Glasgow Townhead and Sheffield Devonshire Green) using a four-chart composite visualisation built in R (ggplot2).  
The goal is to explain seasonal behaviour, pollutant co-variation, and how meteorology (temperature, wind speed, wind direction) shapes observed concentrations.

Question: How do PM2.5, PM10, NO₂ and O₃ vary across seasons and years, and how are high-pollution events linked to wind and temperature conditions across the two sites?

Key messages:
- Primary pollutants (NO₂, PM2.5, PM10) peak in winter, while O₃ peaks in summer.
- PM2.5 and NO₂ co-vary strongly under low wind speeds and specific wind sectors (directional transport + reduced dispersion).
- Temperature patterns separate photochemical ozone behaviour from primary pollutant accumulation.
- Polar wind-direction × wind-speed summaries reveal stable directional hotspots for elevated PM2.5.
